A particular focus in the third edition has been modernizing the 2017
second edition text and the remaining 2014 first edition text.  In
addition, many concepts that are relevant to contempory Bitcoin
development in 2023 have been added:

<<ch04_keys_addresses>>::
  We rearranged the address info so that we work through everything in
  historical order, adding a new section with P2PK (where "address" was "IP
  address"), refreshed the previous P2PKH and P2SH sections, and then added new
  sections for segwit/bech32 and taproot/bech32m.

Old Chapters 6 and 7::
  Text from previous versions of Chapter 6, "Transactions," and Chapter 7,
  "Advanced Transactions," has been rearranged and expanded across four
  new chapters:  pass:[<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="#c_transactions">#c_transactions</a>]  (the structure of transactions), pass:[<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="#c_authorization_authentication">#c_authorization_authentication</a>], pass:[<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="#c_signatures">#c_signatures</a>], and
   pass:[<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="#tx_fees">#tx_fees</a>].

<<c_transactions>>::
  We added almost entirely new text describing the structure of a transaction.

<<c_authorization_authentication>>::
  We added new text about MAST, P2C, scriptless multisignatures, taproot, and
  tapscript.

<<c_signatures>>::
  We revised the  ECDSA text and added new text about schnorr signatures,
  multisignatures, and threshold signatures.

<<tx_fees>>::
  We added almost entirely new text about fees, RBF and CPFP fee
  bumping, transaction pinning, package relay, and CPFP carve-out.

<<bitcoin_network_ch08>>::
  We added text about compact block relay, added a significant update to bloom filters that better describes their privacy problems, and new text about compact block filters.

<<blockchain>>::
  We added text about signet.

<<mining>>::
  We added text about BIP8 and speedy trial.

Appendixes::
  We removed library-specific appendixes. After the appendix containing the original whitepaper, we added a new appendix describing how the implementation and properties of Bitcoin differ from those proposed in the whitepaper.
