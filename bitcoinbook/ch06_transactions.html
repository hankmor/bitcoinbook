<p>The way we typically transfer physical cash has little resemblance to
the way we transfer bitcoins.  Physical cash is a bearer token.  Alice
pays Bob by handing him some number of tokens, such as dollar bills.
By comparison, bitcoins don&#8217;t exist either physically or as digital
data&#8212;&#8203;Alice can&#8217;t hand Bob some bitcoins or send them by email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, consider how Alice might transfer control over a parcel of land
to Bob.  She can&#8217;t physically pick up the land and hand it to Bob.
Rather there exists some sort of record (usually maintained by a local
government) that describes the land Alice owns.  Alice transfers that
land to Bob by convincing the government to update the record to say
that Bob now owns the land.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin works in a similar way.  There exists a database on every
Bitcoin full node that says that Alice controls some number of
bitcoins. Alice pays Bob by convincing full nodes to update their
database to say that some of Alice&#8217;s bitcoins are now controlled by Bob.
The data that Alice uses to convince full nodes to update their
databases is called a <em>transaction</em>.  This is done without directly
using either Alice&#8217;s or Bob&#8217;s identities, as we&#8217;ll see in
<a href="#c_authorization_authentication">[c_authorization_authentication]</a>.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Core&#8217;s serialization format is special because it&#8217;s the format
used to make commitments to transactions and to relay them across
Bitcoin&#8217;s P2P network, but otherwise programs can use
a different format as long as they transmit all of the
same data.  However, Bitcoin Core&#8217;s format is reasonably compact for the
data it transmits and simple to parse, so many other Bitcoin programs
use this format.</p>

<p>The only other widely used transaction serialization format that
we&#8217;re aware of is the partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) format
documented in BIPs 174 and 370 (with extensions documented in other
BIPs).  PSBT allows an untrusted program to produce a transaction
template that can be verified and updated by trusted programs (such as
hardware signing devices) that have the necessary private keys or
other sensitive data to fill in the template.  To accomplish this, PSBT
allows storing a significant amount of metadata about a transaction,
making it much less compact than the standard serialization format.
This book does not go into detail about PSBT, but we strongly recommend
it to developers of wallets that plan to support signing
with multiple keys.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first four bytes of a serialized Bitcoin transaction are its
version.  The original version of Bitcoin transactions was version 1
(0x01000000).  All transactions in Bitcoin must follow
the rules of version 1 transactions, with many of those rules being
described throughout this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version 2 Bitcoin transactions were introduced in the BIP68 soft fork
change to Bitcoin&#8217;s consensus rules.  BIP68 places additional
constraints on the sequence field, but those constraints only apply to
transactions with version 2 or higher.  Version 1 transactions are
unaffected.  BIP112, which was part of the same soft fork as BIP68,
upgraded an opcode (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY), which will now fail if it is
evaluated as part of a transaction with a version less than 2.  Beyond
those two changes, version 2 transactions are identical to version 1
transactions.</p>

<div class="title">Protecting Presigned Transactions</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last step before broadcasting a transaction to the network for
inclusion in the blockchain is to sign it.  However, it&#8217;s possible to
sign a transaction without broadcasting it immediately.  You can save
that presigned transaction for months or years in the belief that it
can be added to the blockchain later when you do broadcast it.  In the
interim, you may even lose access to the private key (or keys) necessary
to sign an alternative transaction spending the funds.  This isn&#8217;t
hypothetical: several protocols built on Bitcoin, including Lightning
Network, depend on presigned <span class="keep-together">transactions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a challenge for protocol developers when they assist users
in upgrading the Bitcoin consensus protocol.  Adding new
constraints&#8212;&#8203;such as BIP68 did to the sequence field&#8212;&#8203;may invalidate
some presigned transactions.  If there&#8217;s no way to create a new
signature for an equivalent transaction, then the money being spent in
the presigned transaction is permanently lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This problem is solved by reserving some transaction features for
upgrades, such as version numbers.  Anyone creating presigned
transactions prior to BIP68 should have been using version 1
transactions, so only applying BIP68&#8217;s additional constraints on
sequence to transactions v2 or higher should not invalidate any
presigned <span class="keep-together">transactions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you implement a protocol that uses presigned transactions, ensure
that it doesn&#8217;t use any features that are reserved for future upgrades.
Bitcoin Core&#8217;s default transaction relay policy does not allow the use
of reserved features.  You can test whether a transaction complies with
that policy by using Bitcoin Core&#8217;s testmempoolaccept RPC on Bitcoin
mainnet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of this writing, a proposal to begin using version 3 transactions is
being widely considered.  That proposal does not seek to change the
consensus rules but only the policy that Bitcoin full nodes use to relay
transactions.  Under the proposal, version 3 transactions would be
subject to additional constraints in order to prevent certain denial of
service (DoS) attacks that we&#8217;ll discuss further in <a href="#transaction_pinning">[transaction_pinning]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_extended_marker_and_flag">Extended Marker and Flag</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next two fields of the example serialized transaction were added as
part of the segregated witness (segwit) soft fork change to Bitcoin&#8217;s
consensus rules.  The rules were changed according to BIPs 141 and 143,
but the <em>extended serialization format</em> is defined in BIP144.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph less_space pagebreak-before">
<p>If the transaction includes a witness structure (which we&#8217;ll describe in
<a href="#witness_structure">Witness Structure</a>), the marker must be zero (0x00) and the flag must be
nonzero.  In the current P2P protocol, the flag should always be one
(0x01); alternative flags are reserved for later protocol upgrades.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the transaction doesn&#8217;t need a witness stack, the marker and flag must not
be present.  This is compatible with the original version of Bitcoin&#8217;s
transaction serialization format, now called <em>legacy serialization</em>.
For details, see <a href="#legacy_serialization">Legacy Serialization</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In legacy serialization, the marker byte would have been interpreted as
the number of inputs (zero).  A transaction can&#8217;t have zero inputs, so
the marker signals to modern programs that extended serialization is
being used.  The flag field provides a similar signal and also
simplifies the process of updating the serialization format in the
future.</p>

<p>Unsigned integers in Bitcoin that often have low values, but which may
sometimes have high values, are usually encoded using the compactSize
data type.  CompactSize is a version of a variable-length integer, so
it&#8217;s sometimes called var_int or varint (see, for example, documentation
for BIPs 37 and 144).</p>

<p>Several varieties of variable length integers are used
in different programs, including in different Bitcoin programs.  For
example, Bitcoin Core serializes its UTXO database using a data type it
calls VarInts, which is different from compactSize.  Additionally, the
nBits field in a Bitcoin block header is encoded using a custom data
type known as Compact, which is unrelated to compactSize.  When
talking about the variable length integers used in Bitcoin transaction
serialization and other parts of the Bitcoin P2P protocol, we will
always use the full name compactSize.</p>

<p>Each input in a transaction must contain three fields: an <em>outpoint</em> field, a length-prefixed <em>input script</em> field, and a <em>sequence</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll look at each of those fields in the following sections.  Some
inputs also include a witness stack, but this is serialized at the end of a
transaction so we&#8217;ll examine it later.</p>

<h4 id="outpoints">Outpoint</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Bitcoin transaction is a request for full nodes to update their
database of coin ownership information.  For Alice to transfer control
of some of her bitcoins to Bob, she first needs to tell full nodes how
to find the previous transfer where she received those bitcoins.  Since
control over bitcoins is assigned in transaction outputs, Alice <em>points</em>
to the previous <em>output</em> using an <em>outpoint</em> field.  Each input must
contain a single outpoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outpoint contains a 32-byte txid for the
transaction where Alice received the bitcoins she now wants to spend.
This txid is in Bitcoin&#8217;s internal byte order for hashes; see
<a href="#internal_and_display_order">Internal and Display Byte Orders</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because transactions may contain multiple outputs, Alice also needs to
identify which particular output from that transaction to use, called
its <em>output index</em>.  Output indexes are 4-byte unsigned
integers starting from zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a full node encounters an outpoint, it uses that information to try
to find the referenced output.  Full nodes are only required to look at earlier
transactions in the blockchain.  For example, Alice&#8217;s transaction is
included in block 774,958.  A full node verifying her transaction
only looks for the previous output referenced by her outpoint in that
block and previous blocks, not any later blocks.  Within block 774,958,
they will only look at transactions placed in the block prior to Alice&#8217;s
transaction, as determined by the order of leaves in the block&#8217;s merkle
tree (see <a href="#merkle_trees">[merkle_trees]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon finding the previous output, the full node obtains several critical
pieces of information from it:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amount of bitcoins assigned to that previous output.  All of those
bitcoins will be transferred in this transaction.  In the example
transaction, the value of the previous output was 100,000 satoshis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authorization conditions for that previous output.  These are the
conditions that must be fulfilled in order to spend the bitcoins
assigned to that previous output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For confirmed transactions, the height of the block that confirmed it
and the median time past (MTP) for that block.  This is required for
relative timelocks (described in <a href="#relative_timelocks">Sequence as a consensus-enforced relative timelock</a>) and outputs
of coinbase transactions (described in <a href="#coinbase_transactions">Coinbase Transactions</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof that the previous output exists in the blockchain (or as a known
unconfirmed transaction) and that no other transaction has spent it.
One of Bitcoin&#8217;s consensus rules forbids any output from being spent
more than once within a valid blockchain.  This is the rule against
<em>double spending</em>: Alice can&#8217;t use the same previous output to pay
both Bob and Carol in separate transactions.  Two transactions that each try to spend the
same previous output are called <em>conflicting transactions</em> because
only one of them can be included in a valid blockchain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different approaches to tracking previous outputs have been tried by
different full node implementations at various times.  Bitcoin Core
currently uses the solution believed to be most effective at retaining
all necessary information while minimizing disk space: it keeps a
database that stores every UTXO and
essential metadata about it (like its confirmation block height).  Each
time a new block of transactions arrives, all of the outputs they spend
are removed from the UTXO database and all of the outputs they create
are added to the database.</p>

they&#8217;re used in commitments for addresses, blocks, transactions,

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sequence field was originally intended to allow creation of
multiple versions of the same transaction, with later versions replacing
earlier versions as candidates for confirmation.  The sequence number
tracked the version of the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, imagine Alice and Bob want to bet on a game of cards.  They
start by each signing a transaction that deposits some money into an
output with a script that requires signatures from both of them to spend, a
<em>multisignature</em> script (<em>multisig</em> for short).  This is called the
<em>setup transaction</em>.  They then create a transaction that spends that
output:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first version of the transaction, with nSequence 0 (0x00000000),
pays Alice and Bob back the money they initially deposited.  This is
called a <em>refund transaction</em>.  Neither of them broadcasts the refund
transaction at this time.  They only need it if there&#8217;s a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice wins the first round of the card game, so the second version of
the transaction, with sequence 1, increases the amount of money paid
to Alice and decreases Bob&#8217;s share.  They both sign the updated
transaction.  Again, they don&#8217;t need to broadcast this version of the
transaction unless there&#8217;s a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob wins the second round, so the sequence is incremented to 2,
Alice&#8217;s share is decreased, and Bob&#8217;s share is increased.  They again
sign but don&#8217;t broadcast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After many more rounds where the sequence is incremented, the
funds redistributed, and the resulting transaction is signed but not
broadcast, they decide to finalize the transaction.  Creating a
transaction with the final balance of funds, they set sequence to its
maximum value (0xffffffff), finalizing the transaction.  They broadcast
this version of the transaction, it&#8217;s relayed across the network, and
eventually confirmed by miners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can see the replacement rules for sequence at work if we consider
alternative scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine that Alice broadcasts the final transaction, with a sequence of
0xffffffff, and then Bob broadcasts one of the earlier transactions
where his balance was higher.  Because Bob&#8217;s version of the
transaction has a lower sequence number, full nodes using the original
Bitcoin code won&#8217;t relay it to miners, and miners who also used the
original code won&#8217;t mine it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In another scenario, imagine that Bob broadcasts an earlier version of
the transaction a few seconds before Alice broadcasts the final
version.  Nodes will relay Bob&#8217;s version and miners will attempt to
mine it, but when Alice&#8217;s version with its higher sequence number
arrives, nodes will also relay it and miners using the original
Bitcoin code will try to mine it instead of Bob&#8217;s version.  Unless Bob
got lucky and a block was discovered before Alice&#8217;s version arrived,
it&#8217;s Alice&#8217;s version of the transaction that will get confirmed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This type of protocol is what we now call a <em>payment channel</em>.
Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, in an email attributed to him, called these
<em>high-frequency transactions</em> and described a number of features added to
the protocol to support them.  We&#8217;ll learn about several of those other
features later and also discover how modern versions of payment channels
are increasingly being used in Bitcoin today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were a few problems with purely sequence-based payment channels.
The first was that the rules for replacing a lower-sequence transaction
with a higher-sequence transaction were only a matter of software
policy.  There was no direct incentive for miners to prefer one version
of the transaction over any other.  The second problem was that the
first person to send their transaction might get lucky and have it
confirmed even if it wasn&#8217;t the highest-sequence transaction.  A
security protocol that fails a few percent of the time due to bad luck
isn&#8217;t a very effective protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third problem was that it was possible to replace one version of a
transaction with a different version an unlimited number of
times.  Each replacement would consume the bandwidth of all the relaying full nodes
on the network.  For example, as of this writing, there are about 50,000
relaying full nodes; an attacker creating 1,000 replacement transactions
per minute at 200 bytes each would use about 20 KB of their
personal bandwidth but about 10 GB of full node network bandwidth
every minute.  Except for the cost of their 20 KB/minute bandwidth and
the occasional fee when a transaction got confirmed, the attacker wouldn&#8217;t
need to pay any costs for the enormous burden they placed on full node
operators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To eliminate the risk of this attack, the original type of
sequence-based transaction replacement was disabled in an early version
of the Bitcoin software.  For several years, Bitcoin full nodes would
not allow an unconfirmed transaction containing a particular input (as
indicated by its outpoint) to be replaced by a different transaction
containing the same input.  However, that situation didn&#8217;t last forever.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="sequence-bip125">Opt-in transaction replacement signaling</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the original sequence-based transaction replacement was disabled
due to the potential for abuse, a solution was proposed: programming
Bitcoin Core and other relaying full node software to allow a
transaction that paid a higher transaction fee rate to replace a
conflicting transaction that paid a lower fee rate.  This is called
<em>replace by fee</em>, or <em>RBF</em> for short.  Some users and businesses
objected to adding support for transaction replacement back into Bitcoin
Core, so a compromise was reached that once again used the sequence
field in support of replacement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As documented in BIP125, an unconfirmed transaction with any input that
has a sequence set to a value below 0xfffffffe (i.e., at least 2 below
the maximum value) signals to the network that its signer wants it to be
replaceable by a conflicting transaction paying a higher fee rate.
Bitcoin Core allowed those unconfirmed transactions to be replaced and
continued to disallow other transactions from being replaced.  This
allowed users and businesses that objected to replacement to simply
ignore unconfirmed transactions containing the BIP125 signal until they
became confirmed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s more to modern transaction replacement policies than fee rates
and sequence signals, which we&#8217;ll see in <a href="#rbf">[rbf]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="relative_timelocks">Sequence as a consensus-enforced relative timelock</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#version">Version</a>, we learned that the BIP68 soft fork added
a new constraint to transactions with version numbers 2 or higher.  That
constraint applies to the sequence field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transaction inputs with sequence values less than 2<sup>31</sup> are
interpreted as having a relative timelock. Such a transaction may only
be included in the blockchain once the previous output (referenced by the
outpoint) has aged by the relative timelock amount. For example, a
transaction with one input with a relative timelock of 30 blocks can
only be confirmed in a block with at least 29 blocks between it and the
block containing the output being spent on the same blockchain.
Since sequence is a per-input field, a transaction may contain any
number of timelocked inputs, all of which must have sufficiently aged
for the transaction to be valid. A disable flag allows a transaction to
include both inputs with a relative timelock (sequence &lt; 2<sup>31</sup>) and
inputs without a relative timelock (sequence ≥ 2<sup>31</sup>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sequence value is specified in either blocks or seconds.
A type-flag
is used to differentiate between values counting blocks and values
counting time in seconds. The type-flag is set in the 23rd
least-significant bit (i.e., value 1&lt;&lt;22). If the type-flag is set, then
the sequence value is interpreted as a multiple of 512 seconds. If
the type-flag is not set, the sequence value is interpreted as a
number of blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When interpreting sequence as a relative timelock, only the 16 least
significant bits are considered. Once the flags (bits 32 and 23) are
evaluated, the sequence value is usually "masked" with a 16-bit mask
(e.g., sequence &amp; 0x0000FFFF).  The multiple of 512 seconds is
roughly equal to the average amount of time between blocks, so the
maximum relative timelock in both blocks and seconds from 16 bits
(2<sup>16</sup>) is a bit more than one year.</p>

<h5 id="uneconomical_outputs">Uneconomical outputs and disallowed dust</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite not having any value, a zero-value output can be spent under
the same rules as any other output.  However, spending an output (using
it as the input in a transaction) increases the size of a transaction,
which increases the amount of fee that needs to be paid.  If the value
of the output is less than the cost of the additional fee, then it doesn&#8217;t
make economic sense to spend the output.  Such outputs are known as
<em>uneconomical outputs</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A zero-value output is always an uneconomical output; it wouldn&#8217;t
contribute any value to a transaction spending it even if the
transaction&#8217;s fee rate was zero.  However, many other outputs with low
values can be uneconomical as well, even unintentionally.  For example,
at a typical fee rate on the network today, an output might add more
value to a transaction than it costs to spend&#8212;&#8203;but tomorrow, fee rates
might rise and make the output uneconomical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The need for full nodes to keep track of all UTXOs, as described in <a href="#outpoints">Outpoint</a>, means that every UTXO makes it
slightly harder to run a full node.  For UTXOs containing significant
value, there&#8217;s an incentive to eventually spend them, so they aren&#8217;t a
problem.  But there&#8217;s no incentive for the person controlling an
uneconomical UTXO to ever spend it, potentially making it a perpetual
burden on operators of full nodes.  Because Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralization
depends on many people being willing to run full nodes, several full
node implementations such as Bitcoin Core discourage the creation of
uneconomical outputs using policies that affect the relay and mining of
unconfirmed transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph less_space pagebreak-before">
<p>The policies against relaying or mining transactions creating new
uneconomical outputs are called <em>dust</em> policies, based on a metaphorical
comparison between outputs with very small values and particles with
very small size.  Bitcoin Core&#8217;s dust policy is complicated and contains
several arbitrary numbers, so many programs we&#8217;re aware of simply
assume outputs with less than 546 satoshis are dust and will not be
relayed or mined by default.  There are occasionally proposals to lower
dust limits, and counterproposals to raise them, so we encourage
developers using presigned transactions or multiparty protocols to
check whether the policy has changed since publication of this book.</p>

<p>Since Bitcoin&#8217;s inception, every full node has needed to keep a copy of
every UTXO, but that might not always be
the case.  Several developers have been working on Utreexo, a project
that allows full nodes to store a commitment to the set of UTXOs rather
than the data itself.  A minimal commitment might be only a kilobyte or
two in size&#8212;&#8203;compare that to the over five gigabytes Bitcoin Core stores
as of this writing.</p>

<p>However, Utreexo will still require some nodes to store all UTXO data,

<p>Bitcoin Core&#8217;s policy rules about dust do have one exception: output
scripts starting with OP_RETURN, called <em>data carrier outputs</em>,

immediately fail no matter what comes after it, so these outputs can
never be spent.  That means full nodes don&#8217;t need to keep track of them,
a feature Bitcoin Core takes advantage of to allow users to store small
amounts of arbitrary data in the blockchain without increasing the size
of its UTXO database.  Since the outputs are unspendable, they aren&#8217;t
uneconomical&#8212;&#8203;any satoshis assigned to them become

<p>Bitcoin Core&#8217;s policy for relaying and mining transactions effectively
limits output scripts to just a few templates, called <em>standard
transaction outputs</em>.  This was originally implemented after the
discovery of several early bugs in Bitcoin related to the Script
language and is retained in modern Bitcoin Core to support
anyone-can-spend upgrades and to encourage the best practice of placing
script conditions in P2SH redeem scripts, segwit v0 witness scripts, and
segwit v1 (taproot) leaf scripts.</p>

<h3 id="witness_structure">Witness Structure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In court, a witness is someone who testifies that they saw something
important happen.  Human witnesses aren&#8217;t always reliable, so courts
have various processes for interrogating witnesses to (ideally) only
accept evidence from those who are reliable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine what a witness would look like for a math problem.  For example,
if the important problem was <em>x + 2 == 4</em> and someone claimed they
witnessed the solution, what would we ask them?  We&#8217;d want a
mathematical proof that showed a value that could be summed with two to
equal four.  We could even omit the need for a person and just use the
proposed value for <em>x</em> as our witness.  If we were told that the witness
was <em>two</em>, then we could fill in the equation, check that it was correct, and
decide that the important problem had been solved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When spending bitcoins, the important problem we want to solve is
determining whether the spend was authorized by the person or people who
control those bitcoins.  The thousands of full nodes that enforce
Bitcoin&#8217;s consensus rules can&#8217;t interrogate human witnesses, but they can
accept <em>witnesses</em> that consist entirely of data for solving math
problems.  For example, a witness of <em>2</em> will allow spending bitcoins
protected by the following script:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>2 OP_ADD 4 OP_EQUAL</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, allowing your bitcoins to be spent by anyone who can solve a
simple equation wouldn&#8217;t be secure.  As we&#8217;ll see in <a href="#c_signatures">[c_signatures]</a>, an
unforgeable digital signature scheme uses an equation that can only be
solved by someone in possession of certain data they&#8217;re able to
keep secret.  They&#8217;re able to reference that secret data using a public
identifier.  That public identifier is called a <em>public key</em> and a
solution to the equation is called a <em>signature</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following script contains a public key and an opcode that requires
a corresponding signature commit to the data in the spending transaction.  Like
the number <em>2</em> in our simple example, the signature is our witness:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;public key&gt; OP_CHECKSIG</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Witnesses, the values used to solve the math problems that protect
bitcoins, need to be included in the transactions where they&#8217;re used in
order for full nodes to verify them.  In the legacy transaction format
used for all early Bitcoin transactions, signatures and other data are
placed in the input script field.  However, when developers started to
implement contract protocols on Bitcoin, such as we saw in
<a href="#original_tx_replacement">Original sequence-based transaction replacement</a>, they discovered several significant
problems with placing witnesses in the input script field.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_circular_dependencies">Circular Dependencies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many contract protocols for Bitcoin involve a series of transactions
that are signed out of order.  For example, Alice and Bob want to
deposit funds into a script that can only be spent with signatures from
both of them, but they each also want to get their money back if the
other person becomes unresponsive.  A simple solution is to sign
transactions out of order:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tx<sub>0</sub> pays money from Alice and money from Bob into an output with a
script that requires signatures from both Alice and Bob to spend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tx<sub>1</sub> spends the previous output to two outputs, one refunding Alice
her money and one refunding Bob his money (minus a small amount for
transaction fees).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Alice and Bob sign Tx<sub>1</sub> before they sign Tx<sub>0</sub>, then they&#8217;re both
guaranteed to be able to get a refund at any time.  The protocol
doesn&#8217;t require either of them to trust the other, making it a <em>trustless
protocol</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A problem with this construction in the legacy transaction format is
that every field, including the input script field that contains
signatures, is used to derive a <span class="keep-together">transaction&#8217;s</span> identifier (txid).  The
txid for Tx<sub>0</sub> is part of the input&#8217;s outpoint in Tx<sub>1</sub>.  That means
there&#8217;s no way for Alice and Bob to construct Tx<sub>1</sub> until both
signatures for Tx<sub>0</sub> are known&#8212;&#8203;but if they know the signatures for
Tx<sub>0</sub>, one of them can broadcast that transaction before signing the
refund transaction, eliminating the guarantee of a refund.  This is a
<em>circular dependency</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_third_party_transaction_malleability">Third-Party Transaction Malleability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A more complex series of transactions can sometimes eliminate a circular
dependency, but many protocols will then encounter a new concern: it&#8217;s
often possible to solve the same script in different ways.  For example,
consider our simple script from <a href="#witness_structure">Witness Structure</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>2 OP_ADD 4 OP_EQUAL</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can make this script pass by providing the value <em>2</em> in an input script,
but there are several ways to put that value on the stack in Bitcoin.
Here are just a few:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>OP_2
OP_PUSH1 0x02
OP_PUSH2 0x0002
OP_PUSH3 0x000002
...
OP_PUSHDATA1 0x0102
OP_PUSHDATA1 0x020002
...
OP_PUSHDATA2 0x000102
OP_PUSHDATA2 0x00020002
...
OP_PUSHDATA4 0x0000000102
OP_PUSHDATA4 0x000000020002
...</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each alternative encoding of the number <em>2</em> in an input script will produce
a slightly different transaction with a completely different txid.  Each
different version of the transaction spends the same inputs (outpoints)
as every other version of the transaction, making them all <em>conflict</em>
with each other.  Only one version of a set of conflicting transactions
can be contained within a valid blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine Alice creates one version of the transaction with OP_2 in the
input script and an output that pays Bob.  Bob then immediately spends that
output to Carol.  Anyone on the network can replace OP_2 with
OP_PUSH1 0x02, creating a conflict with Alice&#8217;s original version.  If
that conflicting transaction is confirmed, then there&#8217;s no way to
include Alice&#8217;s original version in the same blockchain, which means
there&#8217;s no way for Bob&#8217;s transaction to spend its output.
Bob&#8217;s payment to Carol has been made invalid even though neither Alice,
Bob, nor Carol did anything wrong.  Someone not involved in the
transaction (a third party) was able to change (mutate) Alice&#8217;s
transaction, a problem called <em>unwanted third-party transaction
malleability</em>.</p>

<p>There are cases when people want their transactions to be malleable and
Bitcoin provides several features to support that, most notably the
signature hashes (sighash) we&#8217;ll learn about in <a href="#sighash_types">[sighash_types]</a>.  For
example, Alice can use a sighash to allow Bob to help her pay some
transaction fees.  This mutates Alice&#8217;s transaction but only in a way
that Alice wants.  For that reason, we will occasionally prefix the
word <em>unwanted</em> to the term <em>transaction malleability</em>.  Even when we
and other Bitcoin technical writers use the shorter term, we&#8217;re almost
certainly talking about the unwanted variant of malleability.</p>

<h4 id="_second_party_transaction_malleability">Second-Party Transaction Malleability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the legacy transaction format was the only transaction format,
developers worked on proposals to minimize third-party malleability,
such as BIP62.  However, even if they were able to entirely eliminate
third-party malleability, users of contract protocols faced another problem:
if they required a signature from someone else involved in the protocol,
that person could generate alternative signatures and change the txid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, Alice and Bob have deposited their money into a script
requiring a signature from both of them to spend.  They&#8217;ve also created
a refund transaction that allows each of them to get their money back at
any time.  Alice decides she wants to spend just some of the
money, so she cooperates with Bob to create a chain of transactions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tx<sub>0</sub> includes signatures from both Alice and Bob, spending its
bitcoins to two outputs.  The first output spends some of Alice&#8217;s
money; the second output returns the remainder of the bitcoins back to
the script requiring Alice and <span class="keep-together">Bob&#8217;s signatures.</span>  Before signing this
transaction, they create a new refund transaction, Tx<sub>1</sub>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tx<sub>1</sub> spends the second output of Tx<sub>0</sub> to two new outputs, one to
Alice for her share of the joint funds, and one to Bob for his share.
Alice and Bob both sign this transaction before they sign Tx<sub>0</sub>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s no circular dependency here and, if we ignore third-party
transaction malleability, this looks like it should provide us with a
trustless protocol.  However, it&#8217;s a property of Bitcoin signatures that
the signer has to choose a large random number when creating their
signature.  Choosing a different random number will produce a different
signature even if everything being signed stays the same.  It&#8217;s sort of
like how, if you provide a handwritten signature for two copies of the
same contract, each of those physical signatures will look slightly
different.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This mutability of signatures means that, if Alice tries to broadcast
Tx<sub>0</sub> (which contains Bob&#8217;s signature), Bob can generate an alternative
signature to create a conflicting transaction with a different txid.  If
Bob&#8217;s alternative version of Tx<sub>0</sub> gets confirmed, then Alice can&#8217;t use
the presigned version of Tx<sub>1</sub> to claim her refund.  This type of
mutation is called <em>unwanted second-party transaction malleability</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="segwit">Segregated Witness</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As early as <a href="https://oreil.ly/---bp">2011</a>,
protocol developers knew how to solve the problems of circular
dependence, third-party malleability, and second-party malleability.  The
idea was to avoid including the input script in the calculation that
produces a transaction&#8217;s txid.  Recall that an abstract name for the data
held by an input script is a <em>witness</em>.  The idea of separating the rest of
the data in a transaction from its witness for the purpose of generating
a txid is called <em>segregated witness</em> (segwit).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The obvious method for implementing segwit requires a
change to Bitcoin&#8217;s consensus rules that would not be compatible with
older full nodes, also called
a <em>hard fork</em>.  Hard forks come with a lot of challenges, as we&#8217;ll
discuss further in <a href="#hard_forks">[hard_forks]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative approach to segwit was described in late 2015.  This
would use a backward-compatible change to the consensus rules, called a
<em>soft fork</em>.  Backward compatible means that full nodes implementing
the change must not accept any blocks that full nodes without the change
would consider invalid.  As long as they obey that rule, newer full
nodes can reject blocks that older full nodes would accept, giving them
the ability to enforce new consensus rules (but only if the newer full
nodes represent the economic consensus among Bitcoin users&#8212;&#8203;we&#8217;ll
explore the details of upgrading Bitcoin&#8217;s consensus rules in
<a href="#mining">[mining]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The soft fork segwit approach is based on anyone-can-spend
output scripts.  A script that starts with any of the numbers 0 to 16
and followed by 2 to 40 bytes of data is defined as a segwit
output script template.  The number indicates its version (e.g., 0 is
segwit version 0, or <em>segwit v0</em>).  The data is called a <em>witness
program</em>.  It&#8217;s also possible to wrap the segwit template in a P2SH
commitment, but we won&#8217;t deal with that in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the perspective of old nodes, these output script templates can be
spent with an empty input script.  From the perspective of a new node that
is aware of the new segwit rules, any payment to a segwit output script
template must only be spent with an empty input script.  Notice the
difference here: old nodes <em>allow</em> an empty input script; new nodes
<em>require</em> an empty input script.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph less_space pagebreak-before">
<p>An empty input script keeps witnesses from affecting the txid, eliminating
circular dependencies, third-party transaction malleability, and
second-party transaction malleability.  But, with no ability to put
data in an input script, users of segwit output script templates need a
new field.  That field is called the <em>witness structure</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The introduction of witness programs and the witness structure complicates Bitcoin,
but it follows an existing trend of increasing abstraction.  Recall from
<a href="#ch04_keys_addresses">[ch04_keys_addresses]</a> that the original Bitcoin whitepaper describes a system
where bitcoins were received to public keys (pubkeys) and spent with
signatures (sigs).  The public key defined who was <em>authorized</em> to spend
the bitcoins (whoever controlled the corresponding private key) and the
signature provided <em>authentication</em> that the spending transaction came
from someone who controlled the private key.  To make that system more
flexible, the initial release of Bitcoin introduced scripts that allow
bitcoins to be received to output scripts and spent with input scripts.
Later experience with contract protocols inspired allowing bitcoins to
be received to witness programs and spent with the witness structure. The terms and fields used in different versions of Bitcoin are shown in <a href="#terms_used_authorization_authentication">[terms_used_authorization_authentication]</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final field in a serialized transaction is its lock time.  This
field was part of Bitcoin&#8217;s original serialization format, but it was
initially only enforced by Bitcoin&#8217;s policy for choosing which
transactions to mine.  Bitcoin&#8217;s earliest known soft fork added a rule
that, starting at block height 31,000, forbid the inclusion of a
transaction in a block unless it satisfies one of the following rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transaction indicates that it should be eligible for inclusion in
any block by setting its lock time to 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction indicates that it wants to restrict which blocks it
can be included in by setting its lock time to a value less than
500,000,000.  In this case, the transaction can only be included in a
block that has a height equal to the lock time or higher.  For
example, a transaction with a lock time of 123,456 can be included in
block 123,456 or any later block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction indicates that it wants to restrict when it can be
included in the blockchain by setting its lock time to a value of
500,000,000 or greater.  In this case, the field is parsed as epoch
time (the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00 UTC) and the
transaction can only be included in a block with a <em>median time past</em>
(MTP) greater than the lock time.  MTP is normally about an hour or
two behind the current time.  The rules for MTP are described in
<a href="#mtp">[mtp]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="coinbase_transactions">Coinbase Transactions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first transaction in each block is a special case.  Most older
documentation calls this a <em>generation transaction</em>, but most newer
documentation calls it a <em>coinbase transaction</em> (not to be confused with
transactions created by the company named "Coinbase").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coinbase transactions are created by the miner of the block that
includes them and gives the miner the option to claim any fees paid by
transactions in that block.  Additionally, up until block 6,720,000,
miners are allowed to claim a subsidy consisting of bitcoins that have
never previously been circulated, called the <em>block subsidy</em>.  The total
amount a miner can claim for a block&#8212;&#8203;the combination of fees and
subsidy&#8212;&#8203;is called the <em>block reward</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the special rules for coinbase transactions include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They may only have one input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The single input must have an outpoint with a null txid (consisting entirely
of zeros) and a maximal output index (0xffffffff).  This prevents the
coinbase transaction from referencing a previous transaction output,
which would (at the very least) be confusing given that the coinbase
transaction pays out fees and subsidy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The field that would contain an input script in a normal transaction is
called a <em>coinbase</em>.  It&#8217;s this field that gives the coinbase
transaction its name.  The coinbase field must be at least two bytes
and not longer than 100 bytes.  This script is not executed but legacy
transaction limits on the number of signature-checking operations
(sigops) do apply to it, so any arbitrary data placed in it should be
prefixed by a data-pushing opcode.  Since a 2013 soft fork defined in
BIP34, the first few bytes of this field must follow additional rules
we&#8217;ll describe in <a href="#duplicate_transactions">[duplicate_transactions]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sum of the outputs must not exceed the value of the fees collected
from all the transactions in that block plus the subsidy.  The subsidy
started at 50 BTC per block and halves every 210,000 blocks
(approximately every four years).  Subsidy values are rounded down to the
nearest satoshi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the 2017 segwit soft fork documented in BIP141, any block that contains
a transaction spending a segwit output must contain an output to the
coinbase transaction that commits to all of the transactions in the
block (including their witnesses).  We&#8217;ll explore this commitment in
<a href="#mining">[mining]</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A coinbase transaction can have any other outputs that would be valid in
a normal transaction.  However, a transaction spending one of those
outputs cannot be included in any block until after the coinbase
transaction has received 100 confirmations.  This is called the
<em>maturity rule</em>, and coinbase transaction outputs that don&#8217;t yet have
100 confirmations are called <em>immature</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Bitcoin software doesn&#8217;t need to deal with coinbase transactions,
but their special nature does mean they can occasionally be the cause of
unusual problems in software that&#8217;s not designed to expect them.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_weight_and_vbytes">Weight and Vbytes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each Bitcoin block is limited in the amount of transaction data it can
contain, so most Bitcoin software needs to be able to measure the
transactions it creates or processes.  The modern unit of measurement
for Bitcoin is called <em>weight</em>.  An alternative version of weight is
<em>vbytes</em>, where four units of weight equal one vbyte, providing an easy
comparison to the original <em>byte</em> measurement unit used in legacy
Bitcoin blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blocks are limited to 4 million weight.  The block header takes up 240
weight.  An additional field, the transaction count, uses either 4 or
12 weight.  All of the remaining weight may be used for transaction
data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To calculate the weight of a particular field in a transaction, the size
of that serialized field in bytes is multiplied by a factor.  To
calculate the weight of a transaction, sum together the weights of all
of its fields.  The factors for each of the fields in a transaction are
shown in <a href="#weight_factors">[weight_factors]</a>.  To provide an example, we also calculate
the weight of each field in this chapter&#8217;s example transaction from
Alice to Bob.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The factors, and the fields to which they are applied, were chosen to
reduce the weight used when spending a UTXO.  This helps discourage the
creation of uneconomical outputs as described in

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The serialization format described in this chapter is used for the
majority of new Bitcoin transactions as of the writing of this book, but
an older serialization format is still used for many transactions.  That
older format, called <em>legacy serialization</em>, must be used on the Bitcoin
P2P network for any transaction with an empty witness structure (which is only
valid if the transaction doesn&#8217;t spend any witness programs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legacy serialization does not include the marker, flag, and witness structure
fields.</p>
</div>
<p class="fix_tracking2">
In this chapter, we looked at each of the fields in a transaction and
discovered how they communicate to full nodes the details about the
bitcoins to be transferred between users.  We only briefly looked at the
output script, input script, and witness structure that allow specifying and
satisfying conditions that restrict who can spend what bitcoins.
Understanding how to construct and use these conditions is essential to
ensuring that only Alice can spend her bitcoins, so they will be the
subject of the next chapter.</p>
